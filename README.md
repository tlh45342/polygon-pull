# polygon-pull
example code for pulling financial data using polygon-io

This a "test" project. 
The example piece does have the storage address hardcoded to drive M.
I run python on Windows, Linux, and Apple.
It is expected that you would alter the code to fit your environment.

The example files in pull_1M show a piece of code in a series of strages of development.

The file pull_v3.py uses a CSV file aptly named "tradingpool.csv" as the source for a series of downloads.

## INSTALLATION

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tlh45342/polygon-pull.git
```

To make sure you have all the python modules installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Most notably:
